Frontend Development Portfolio
Welcome to my frontend development portfolio! This repository showcases my projects and examples using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating my progress and skills in web development.

About Me
I started my journey in frontend development in 2021. However, I had to take a break for a year due to university exams. I resumed my learning and development one month ago, and this repository is a testament to my dedication and growth over the past five years and I am continuing to create new projects
